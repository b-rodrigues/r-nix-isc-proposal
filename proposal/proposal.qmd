Our proposal centers on leveraging Nix, a package manager built for reproducible
builds, to completely package CRAN and Bioconductor for R. Nix makes it easy to
install multiple versions of packages and supports per-project development
environments, all while operating seamlessly across various operating systems
and architectures. Although CRAN and Bioconductor are already packaged with Nix,
not all packages are available as binaries and thus must be compiled from
source. Our goal is to extend this to cover the entire repositories—including
older versions—to ensure full reproducibility and stability for the R community.

By investing in dedicated hardware and developing thorough documentation, we aim
to simplify the process for R users. This initiative will provide reliable,
reproducible environments that benefit everyone from data scientists to
statisticians, ultimately enhancing collaborative work and continuous
integration across diverse systems.

Our minimum viable product will consist of a build farm that leverages a variety
of hardware running both Linux and macOS. This setup ensures that we can compile
binaries across different operating systems. To automate the build process, we
will use Hydra, the continuous integration tool from NixOS, which will compile
the binaries efficiently. In addition, we plan to integrate an S3 storage
solution to cache and distribute these binary packages effectively, ensuring
they are quickly and reliably accessible to all users.

Our architecture ... *here I think we should have a diagram?*

We assume that sufficient funding and hardware resources will be available to
build and maintain this infrastructure. It is also anticipated that the existing
Nix ecosystem can be scaled to cover the full scope of CRAN and Bioconductor
repositories. Moreover, with the support of improved and user-friendly
documentation, we expect that R users will readily adopt Nix, easing their
transition to a reproducible build environment.

Overall, this proposal offers a robust solution to the challenges of managing R
packages across diverse environments, ensuring consistency, reliability, and
enhanced reproducibility for the entire R community.
