Our proposal aims to extend the power of Nix, a package manager designed for reproducible builds, 
to fully support CRAN and Bioconductor for R. Nix already enables seamless installation of multiple
package versions and per-project development environments across different operating systems and architectures. 
While CRAN and Bioconductor are partially available through Nix today, many packages still need to be compiled from source. 
Our goal is to cover the entire repositories—including historical versions—so that the R community can rely on complete reproducibility and long-term stability.

To achieve this, we will invest in dedicated hardware and produce clear documentation, 
lowering the barriers for R users and making reproducible environments more accessible. 
This initiative will benefit researchers, data scientists, and statisticians alike, 
while improving collaborative workflows and continuous integration practices across platforms.

The minimum viable product is straightforward. The NixOS Foundation already operates a build farm that 
compiles binaries for nearly all of the 120,000 packages available through Nix. Our proposal is to purchase 
additional hardware and donate it to the NixOS Foundation, which would then integrate it into their 
existing infrastructure to build R package binaries at scale.

We have already confirmed with the NixOS Foundation that they are open to this arrangement. 
The main question is whether we should purchase and donate the hardware directly, 
or transfer the funds to the NixOS Foundation so they can acquire the equipment themselves, which would
be a simpler and more effective approach.

In short, this project delivers a practical, community-oriented solution to the persistent 
challenges of managing R packages across diverse environments. 
By ensuring consistency, reliability, and reproducibility, 
it strengthens the foundation for R’s long-term growth and collaborative potential.
