# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->
The project will be considered complete when the following conditions are met:
- A formal agreement with the NixOS Foundation is signed, dedicating the new hardware to the task of building R package binaries.
- The specified hardware (one x86_64 Linux server and two aarch64-darwin Mac Minis) has been successfully procured and officially transferred to the NixOS Foundation.
- The hardware is fully integrated into the NixOS build farm infrastructure and is actively building packages.
- Comprehensive binary coverage for the entirety of current CRAN and Bioconductor packages is achieved and publicly available for x86_64-linux, aarch64-linux and aarch64-darwin architectures.

## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->
Success will be measured through the following key markers:
- **Integration Confirmation:** Official confirmation from the NixOS Foundation that the donated hardware is online and successfully integrated into their build farm (Hydra).
- **Binary Coverage:** A publicly accessible metric (e.g., a dashboard) tracking the percentage of CRAN and Bioconductor packages with available pre-built binaries. The primary success marker is reaching and maintaining near 100% coverage.

## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->
Upon successful completion, this project can be extended in several ways:
- **Historical Coverage:** A dedicated effort could be launched to build historical versions of all CRAN and Bioconductor packages, providing a complete archive for long-term reproducibility.

## Key risks
<!-- 
What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?

 - [ ] People
 - [ ] Processes
 - [ ] Tooling & Technology
 - [ ] Costs

-->
- **People:** The project relies on a small group of volunteer maintainers from both the R-on-Nix community and the NixOS Foundation. The departure or unavailability of key individuals could create delays in integration or long-term maintenance.
- **Processes:** Delays in formalizing the agreement with the NixOS Foundation or unforeseen logistical complexities in purchasing and transferring hardware internationally could slow down the project's start.
- **Tooling & Technology:** There may be unforeseen technical challenges in integrating the specific hardware into the NixOS build farm. Furthermore, a small subset of R packages with exceptionally complex or non-standard build requirements may not be built successfully for NixOS.
- **Costs:** The estimated hardware cost of ~10,000 EUR may fluctuate due to market price changes or unexpected shipping and import duties.
