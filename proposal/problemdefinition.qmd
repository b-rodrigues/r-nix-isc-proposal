Packaging R packages for different operating systems and architectures
is a difficult and time-consuming task. Building binaries for various
systems requires dealing with different compiler settings, managing
platform-specific dependencies, and ensuring proper functionality
across environments. This often leads to inconsistencies and build
failures, especially when system-level dependencies are not clearly
handled. Deploying the same environment across multiple computers thus
remains a challenge, even though it is essential for collaborative work
and continuous integration.

There have been efforts to ease this process. For example, organizations
like Posit and community projects such as r2u have made progress
in automating binary builds. However, these solutions have some
drawbacks. The Posit Public Package Manager does not manage system-level
dependencies automatically, leaving that work to users, while r2u only
packages the current state of CRAN, which means older package versions
are not available.

To provide R consistently across different operating systems and
hardware platforms requires solving these issues. Tools such as docker
are not solutions as the problem. Docker can capture the entire software
environment—including all necessary dependencies—so that R packages
are run consistently on any system, which improves reproducibility and
makes deployment easier. However, using Docker alone does not ensure
full reproducibility as the issues remain when building the containers
themselves.  Its isolated containers can make interactive, explorative
work more challenging.
